Hello, this is my first project as I'm currently learning HTML, the functionalities of Git and Github thanks to The Odin Project !
This is the draft of a website for cooking recipes, I will display titles, paragraphs, images, and links. Everything will be coded in HTML using Virtual Studio Code. 
By doing this I'm displaying new skills that I acquired thanks to following a number of lessons and that I know the core foundations of HTML, Git and Github. 
Thank you for reading me !
